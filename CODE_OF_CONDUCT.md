## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all Project Tirtha spaces, including:

- GitHub repositories (issues, PRs, discussions)
- Matrix and other chat channels
- Project documentation
- Events, meetings, and workshops
- Any space representing the Project Tirtha community


## Enforcement

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:

- Contact the maintainers, project leads, or chat room moderators directly.

## General Community Guidelines

All participants are expected to:

- Be respectful and considerate in words and actions.
- Assume good faith in others' intentions.
- Welcome newcomers and support learning.
- Give and receive constructive feedback gracefully.
- Disagree thoughtfully, without personal attacks.

Unacceptable behavior includes:

- Harassment, discrimination, or hate speech.
- Personal attacks or sustained hostility.
- Sexualized language or imagery.
- Doxxing or threats.
- Disruptive behavior that derails discussion.


## Tirtha-Specific Guidelines

Because Project Tirtha works with cultural and religious heritage:

- Treat all cultures, traditions, and communities with respect.
- Avoid derogatory or dismissive language about sites, beliefs, or practices.
- Be mindful when discussing heritage from regions affected by conflict or loss.
- Respect contributors who provide images or other data. Do not exploit or misrepresent their work.
- Avoid sensationalizing or commercializing sensitive cultural material.

Our goal is to preserve and celebrate heritage, not to trivialize or appropriate it.
